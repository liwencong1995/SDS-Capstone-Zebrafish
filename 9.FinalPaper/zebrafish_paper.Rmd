abstract: Classification of biological creatures’ phenotypes has long been a field that scientists study at. In this project, we utilize support vector machine to distinguish structures of Zebrafish’s brains by using data generated from landmark analysis (cited Schwartz’s paper). We create a tool for biologists to intuitively classify three-dimensional biological shapes into two groups, usually defined as wild type and mutant, and understand which part of the shapes have the most impact on the classification result. This project derives from Professor Barresi’s biological image analysis research at Smith College.

# Introduction
This project derives from Professor Barresi’s biological image analysis research at Smith College and provides a tool to classify the structures within zebrafish brains via support vector machine. Our goal is to distinguish the wild and mutant types of zebrafish brain’s structures. Schwartz, a student in Barresi Lab, used  landmarks analysis to divide the points in the three-dimentional images into small wedges and computed the landmark, which is the most representative point, within each wedge. The image of signals in a Zebrafish brain is shown in Figure 1. The shape is divided into 30 slices, and each slice is further divided into 8 wedges. The landmark in each wedge is calculated by taking the median distance of all points in each wedge, $R$. We use number of points in each wedge and median R to run SVM models to do classifications.  

## Landmark Analysis

## Programming Languages
Two programming languages are used in this study, Python and R. Python is used to run our model and output the result in the correct format. **R** is used generally for data cleaning and creating interactive user interface.

## Git, `knitr`, and Reproducible Research
Reproducible research and open source are two main points of emphasis in this honors project. As scholars place more emphasis on the reproducibility of research studies, it is essential for us to make our code publicly available for people to recreate both the model and the user interface. 

`knitr` [@pkgknitr] and Github are used in this project to make the study reproducible, ranging from the initial data source to the `nyctaxi` package to the statistical data analysis. We used an **R** package called `rticles` to write this paper. This tool allows authors to create reproducible and dynamic technical scientific paper in **R** Markdown. It also allows users to embed **R** code and interactive applicationis, and output into PDF. `rticles` helps users to efficiently put together scientific paper with similar format [@pkgrticles]. Github is used to store the scripts for our final paper, and the source code for our final production which contains the final model and user interface.

# Literature Review
Research in developmental biology has relied on the analysis of morphological phenotypes through
qualitative examination of maximum intensity projections that surrender the power of three dimensional
data. Statistical methods to analyze visual data are needed, particularly to detect subtle
phenotypes. 

Schwartz et al. (2018) have utilized the open source program, Ilastik, which employs a training based machine learning, to eliminate the image noise. Then they preformed principal component analysis to align commissures between samples, reducing misalignment artifacts, and implemented a cylindrical coordinate system which preserves image dimensionality normally lost in maximum intensity projection (MIP), which facilitates presentation of the data, but sacrifices much of the complexity and relational data contained in the image. Then they reduced the points identified by the program as belonging to the structure to a set of landmark points that describe the shape and distribution of signal corresponding to the structure. Finally, using the landmark system, we are able to identify and quantify structural differences and changes in signal distribution between wild type and mutant commissures.

Landmarks describe a shape by locating a finite number of points on each specimen. There are three basic types of landmarks: scientific, mathematic and pseudo-landmarks. A scientific landmark is a point assigned by an expert that corresponds between objects in some scientifically meaningful way, for example the corner of an eye. Mathematical landmarks are points located on an object according to some mathematical or geometrical property of the figure. Since it does not assume a preference of one location to another, it is particularly useful in automated morphological recognition and analysis for under-studied structure. Pseudo-landmarks are constructed points on an object, located either around the outline or in between scientific or mathematic landmarks. It is often used to approximate continuous curves (Dryden and Mardia, 2016). This research has chosen to calculate an automatic set of landmarks distributed across the structure in order to avoid introducing bias due to expectations about where biological differences should emerge.

Schwartz et al. used Random Forest machine leaning method to classify the landmarks. Although the classification is quite accurate, it is difficult to interpret the result from biological aspects. Instead of doing classification on all of the landmarks at the same time, we decided to do classifacation on one landmark at a time via Support Vector Machine. The SVM algorithm is a classification algorithm that provides state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of application domains, image classification. During the past few years, SVM has been applied very broadly within the field of computational biology especially in pattern recognition problems, including protein remote homology detection, microarray gene expressions analysis, prediction of protein-protein interactions, etc. 

In 1999, Jaakkola et al. ushered in stage 4 of the development of homology detection algorithms with a paper that garnered the “Best paper” award at the annual Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference. Their primary insight was that additional accuracy can be obtained by modeling the difference between positive and negative examples. Because the homology task required discriminating between related and unrelated sequences, explicitly modeling the difference between these two sets of sequences yields an extremely powerful method. 

 

# Data and Variables
We have 43 wildtypes samples ($n_1$) and 35 mutant samples ($n_2$) for training and testing. There are 152 landmarks ($N$) for each sample, with each of them containing the following variables:

* number of points in each wedge
* median $r$ (micro-meter): the median of the distances to the center of the slice of all the points in each wedge
* $\alpha$ (micro-meter): distance from the center of the landmark to the midline
* $\theta$ (radian): the degree the describes the location of a wedge within each slice

We used the number of points and the median R to do classification via support vector machine. For missing ‘median R’ values due to absence of points in particular landmarks, we filled them with the median value of all the points in that landmark.

## Tidy Data
The raw landmarks data is a wide table containing the sample index and all the columns holding information regarding the minimum and maximum values of $\alpha$ and $\theta$, number of points, median r value, and the type of sample for a particular sample in each landmark.  and The value in each cell refers to the median r value or number of points. However, because all of such variables were joined by underscores in the variable names, such as `-14.29_-4.76_-0.79_0.0_50_pts` or `-14.29_-4.76_-0.79_0.0_50_r`, it was very difficult to see what each column actually represented. Thus, the data set was restructured to have the sample index, minimum and maximum $\alpha$, minimum and maximum $\theta$, number of points, median r, and type of sample each be its own column. 

Hence, three key functions were used from the tidyr package [@pkgtidyr]: gather(), separate(), and spread(). The gather() function separated the dataset into key and value pairs for each index. The key was the column name containing all essential information connected by underscores and the value included the number of points or median r value. Then, the separate() function separated the result from the gather function divided the column connected by underscore into 5 different columns, named as `min_alpha`, `max_alpha`, `min_theta`, `max_theta`, and `ptsOrR`. This was added to the result of the gather function that contained the index and value of each cell, either median R or number of points. Afterwards, the spread() function widened the already wide table by expanding the `ptsOrR` column by creating two columns, each column representing median R and the number of points. 

## Dealing with Missing Values
Support Vector Machine (SVM) cannot be fit to data with missing values. For wedges that do not have any points, `median r` cannot be calculated, which means that these sample will be eliminated when running SVM. Wedges without points have biologically meanings, so we should not ignore these wedges in our model. In order to keep the wedges in our model, we need to artificially pick a `median r` value to replace the missing ones. SVM is sensitive to outliers, so we cannot pick an `r` value that could become outliers. We decided to calculate the mean of `median r` for the nth landmark of all 78 samples, and then we replace the missing `median r` values with the 2 * median R value for each landmark of each channel.

# Support Vector Machine
The goal of SVM is to find a separation line $f(x) = (\beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2)$ that separates the nearest data as clean as possible. The parameters $\beta$ are found by solving the optimization problem --to maximize M subject to some restrictions -- in 2 dimensions below. 

```{r svmfig, fig.cap ="SVM", fig.width=5, fig.height=3,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/svm_fig.png", dpi = 260 )
```


\begin{equation}
  \left.
  \begin{array}{l@{\,}l}
     \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i^2 = 0 \\
     \ y_i * ( \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2 ) \geq M(1-\varepsilon_i) \\
     \ \varepsilon_i \geq 0 \\
     \ \sum_{i=1}^n \varepsilon_i \leq C \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}


* $C$: tuning parameter, toleration of misclassification.
* $M$: margin is the distance of the closest points to the hyperplane. It is the distance between the two light grey lines. 
* $\varepsilon_i$ : slack variable, an observation is classified at the correct/incorrect side of the margin.



The slack variable $\varepsilon_i$ tells us where the ith observation is located, relative to the separation line and relative to the margin. If $\varepsilon_i = 0$ then the ith observation is on the correct side of the margin. If $\varepsilon_i > 0$ then the ith observation is on the wrong side of the margin. If $\varepsilon_i > 1$ then it is on the wrong side of the separation line.

The tuning parameter C bounds the sum of the $\varepsilon_i$, and so it determines the number and severity of the violations to the margin and to the separation line that we will tolerate. We can think of C as a budget for the amount that the margin can be violated by the n observations. If $C = 0$ then there is no budget for violations to the margin, and it must be the case that $\varepsilon_1 = . . . = \varepsilon_n = 0$. For $C > 0$ no more than C observations can be on the wrong side of the separation line, because if an observation is on the wrong side of the separation line then $\varepsilon_i > 1$. As the budget C increases, we become more tolerant of violations to the margin, and so the margin will widen. Conversely, as C decreases, we become less tolerant of violations to the margin and so the margin narrows.

The function of the separation line:

$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2 $$
$y_i$ is the vector representing the coordinate of a data point. The dot product of $y_i$ and the function of the seperation line gives the perpendicular distance from the data point to the separation line:

$$ y_i * ( \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2 )$$

If the dot product is greater than 0, the observation falls at the right side of the separation line and vice versa.

## Cross-Validation
For our project, we have access to 43 wild-type samples and 35 mutant-type samples. Due to this limited sample size, we decided to use a leave-one-out cross validation method to test our model.   
For each testing sample, we built 152 SVMs for each landmark.
For each SVM, we used 10-fold cross validation to select a tuning parameter C value among 0.1, 1 and 10.

# Final Product: Two-Step Interactive Classification Tool
We created a two-step interactive classification tool which allows users to simply input a data file and get an visualization of the modeling result. There are two main components in the tool:

## General Workflow
```{r workflow, fig.cap = "Summary of Workflow", fig.width=1, fig.height=1,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure1.jpg", dpi = 260 )
```
**Fig 2** displays the overall workflow leading to the final product of classification. It begins with the cleaning and restructuring of the raw landmarks data. The tidied landmarks data that has the NA values filled contains 152 distinct landmarks. Each landmark has its own representative SVM model that used the 77 samples out of 78 for training from applying the leave-one-out cross validation method. That one sample that is left out from each landmark is used for testing the model that was built from the 77 samples. Then, based on the training accuracy of each model, only those that consist of reliable landmarks are filtered out. The number of wildtypes and mutants predicted with each model are calculated and this leads to the final classification result of using SVMs. 

## Step One: Data Processing and Modelling
This step is implemented using **Python** (version 3) and packages including `pandas`, `numpy` and `sklearn` are required. Users would need to run and interact with the Python script `svm.py` to pre-process the data and build the model. Then, they would need to run another script `analyse_results.py` to analyse the raw results and produce aggregated results.   

The script `svm.py` contains two components: a general-purpose `svm_classification()` function that builds a SVM model to classify points for a perticular landmark and a `main()` function that runs the `svm_classification()` function for each landmark.

The script `analyse_results.py` contains three components: a helper function `get_result_file_pathes()` that returns a list of result file pathes in the output folder; a helper function `process_row_data()` that takes a path of raw data file and returns one with accuracy scores calculated and attached; a `main()` function that runs the two helper function to process all raw data files and generates an aggregated CSV file comtaining results from all samples.

### User Interaction
```{r useri, fig.cap = "Example of User Interaction for Running svm.py", fig.width=5, fig.height=3,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure2.jpg", dpi = 260 )
```
```{r useri2, fig.cap = "Example of User Interaction for Running svm.py", fig.width=5, fig.height=3,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure3.png", dpi = 260 )
```

As shown in **Fig 3** and **Fig 4**, several user inputs are taken from users when they run the python scriptsf.

### Input File 
Input file must contain landmark data. Variables that are needed for classification are required to be included in the input file.
In our analysis, we used number of points in each sub-section corresponding to each landmark of the 3D shape and the `median R` of points in each wedge.

### Sample input file
```{r inputdata, fig.cap ="Random Sample of a Input File for svm.py", out.width = "300px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure4.png", dpi = 260 )
```

**Fig 5** shows a ramdom sample of an input file for the script `svm.py`. The columns `stype`(sample type), `landmark_index` and `sample_index` are arequired and the other two columns (`pts` and `r` in this example) are the two parameters for building SVM.

### Output File
```{r outputdata, fig.cap ="Output File Columns of Aggregated Result", out.width = "300px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure5.png", dpi = 260 )
```

**Fig 6** shows the columns of the final result file produced by the `analyse_results.py` script.


## Step Two: Interactive Visualization Tool
After building SVM models in step one, we insert the output from the SVM models into step two to visualize the results. Steps two uses the accuracy scores output from step one to create a user-friendly app which generates visualizations to help users to understand the SVM results. 

The repository containing the shiny app can be access by doing the following:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liwencong1995/SDS-Capstone-Zebrafish")
```

The file containing the source code of the shiny app can be found in `9.FinalModel` folder of the repository. The file is named as `shiny_app.R`.

### Input 1: Data File and Variables
Input `CSV` data file must be stored in a folder called `data` under your working directory, and the `CSV` file must be named as `output_data.csv`. If you do not know what your working directory is, you can check it by using the function `getwd()` in base R.

All SVM models from step one produce the following 9 accuracy measurements:

1. Precision score of type 0
2. Recall score of type 0
3. F1 score of type 0
4. Precision score of type 1
5. Recall score of type 1 
6. F1 score of type 1
7. Overall precision score
8. Overall recall score
9. Overall F1 score

These 9 accuracy scores are the variables needed in the second step of the user interface to create the visualizations. 

### Input 2: User Inputs
Users can select `channel` and `sample index` to filter the input dataset to only keep the observations that users are interested in.

In addition, users can set the threshold of the following variables:

* Overall precision score
* Overall recall score
* Overall F1 score

The dataset used to create the visualizations is rendered everytime users cahnge one or multiple thresholds. Our app filters out the observations that do not fulfill the threshold requirements and uses the resulting dataset to update the histograms and heatmaps. 

### Output: Interactive User Interface
This interactive user interface was built upon several **R** packages:

* `dplyr` [@pkgdplyr]
* `data.table` [@pkgdatatable]
* `ggplot2` [@pkgggplot2]
* `shiny` [@pkgshiny]

We visualize the 9 accuracy scores by using both histograms and the corresponding heatmaps that display the scores inlcuded in the histograms in rectangular shapes that are colored with different shades of blue according to their magnitudes. The positions of the shapes are determined with respect to their relative positions within the biological structure. In the study of Zebrafish, we used the relative positions of the wedges used in landmark analysis to determine the position of the wedges in the heatmap.

There are 10 tabs included in the user interface of the app: 1 Accuracy Threshold Summary tab and 9 accuracy score visualization tabs.

```{r shiny1, fig.cap= "User Interface: Accuracy Threshold Summary Tab of AT Channel" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shiny1.png", dpi = 260 )
```

Figure 5 displays the Accuracy Score Threshold Summary tab of the first sample of AT channel. Users can drag the dot on the slidebar to set the thresholds of overall precision, recall, and f1 scores. The threshold of the three scores are updated in the summary table. Default thresholds are 0 for all three accuracy measurements. We then use the landmark observations that fulfill the threshold requirements to predict the type of the sample of choice by doing a majority vote. We simply count the total number of landmarks that are classified as type 0 and type 1, and then we determine whether there are more of them that are classified as type 0 or type 1. The type that gets more vote is the predicted type of the sample. The resuting predicted sample type is also updated in the summary table.

Other information, such as the true type of the sample and the number of wildetypes and mutants used in training the SVM models are also included in the summary table.

```{r shiny2, fig.cap= "User Interface: Precision Score Visualization Tab of AT Channel" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shiny2.png", dpi = 260 )
```

Figure 6 displays the Precision Score Visualization tab of the first sample of AT channel. In this case, all three thresholds are at default level, 0. Therefore, all landmarks' precision scores are shown in both the histogram and the heatmap.

```{r shiny3, fig.cap= "User Interface: Precision Score Visualization Tab of AT Channel, with precision threshold = 0.75" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shiny3.png", dpi = 260 )
```

Figure 7 also displays the Precision Score Visualization tab of the first sample of AT channel. In this case, recall and f1 scores' thresholds are at default level and precision threshold is set to be 0.75. Therefore, only landmarks that have precision scores that are equal to or greater than 0.75 are shown in the visualizations. As shown in the histogram, all values less than 0.75 are removed from the histogram in figure 6. Some of the blocks in figure 6 are turned into blank blocks after the precision threshold is increased to 0.75.

```{r shiny8, fig.cap= "User Interface: F1 Score Visualization Tab of ZRF Channel" ,fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shiny8.png", dpi = 260 )
```

Users can also choose to observe the SVM results of ZRF channel. Figure 8 displays the Precision Score Visualization tab of the first sample of ZRF channel with all thresholds equal to 0. More sample visualizations of other accuracy scores can be found in Appendix A. 

# Conclusion and Discussion
## Strengths
Our final product has several strengths:

### Easy Interpretation
In the previous method random forest, the number of predictors $p$ exceeds the number of samples. Schwartz applied PCA to reduce the dimension of the predictors. The problem with dimension reduction is that the parameters gaining weights at last are linear combinations of the original landmarks. While the patterns of the first several projections still make sense, the minor projections are very random and thus difficult to interpret. 

The SVM model is generated based on landmark data gives insightful analysis of:
* which landmark, or which part of the Zebrafish brain, has more predictive power
* whether a new Zebrafish brain sample is a mutant or wild type

### Implementing User Feedback
We have implemented feedbacks from users in our user interface. Originally, our shiny app only produces visualizations of one channel's data, but we added an additional variable, `channel`, for users to analyze three-dimentional data with more or multiple channels. Because of this improvement, it is more convenient for users to compare and contrast results from different channels.

## Limitations and Improvements
### Interaction Between Channels
Our SVM model only make prediction of the sample type based on a single channel's information, and it does not consider the interaction between channels. 

### Iterating Machine Learning
Instead of cross-validation, better results could be achieved by using iterating machine learning method. In iterative machine learning we repeat the process of training and testing several times. At the first round the user gives examples of objects belonging to some classes and the machine learning algorithm is trained with this data. In the second round, the algorithm shows examples of objects it thinks that belong to these classes. Now, the user merely adds objects to the improved training set which the machine learning algorithm has put into a wrong class. That is, the user only corrects the “misunderstandings” of the algorithm. In this way we can concentrate on difficult examples of objects that are hard to classify or are for some reason easily missed by humans. Such objects may lie close to the decision boundaries or in the periphery in the multidimensional feature space. This iterative process is continued until the machine learning algorithm does not make any mistakes or the classification results do not improve anymore. It will improve our classification results and thus is likely to help make better predictions for unknown type. 

## Future Study
### Interaction Between Channels
If more time is given, we could add factors that describe the interaction between channels into our SVM model in order to combine information from multiple channels to predict sample type.

### Improving User Interface
Since we have only received feedback from three users at Smith College, we would love to get more feedbacks from other scientists and improve our model and user interface accordingly.
