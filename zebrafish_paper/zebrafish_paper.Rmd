# Introduction
This project derives from Professor Barresi’s biological image analysis research at Smith College and provides a tool to classify the structures within zebrafish brains via support vector machine. Our goal is to distinguish the wild and mutant types of zebrafish brain’s structures. Morgan, a student in Barresi Lab, used  landmarks analysis to divide the points in the 3D images into small wedges and computed the landmark, which is the most representative point, within each wedge. The image of signals in a Zebrafish brain is shown in Figure 1. The shape is divided into 30 slices, and each slice is further divided into 8 wedges. The landmark in each wedge is calculated by taking the median distance of all points in each wedge, R. We use number of points in each wedge and median R to run SVM models to do classifications.

# Literature Review

Research in developmental biology has relied on the analysis of morphological phenotypes through
qualitative examination of maximum intensity projections that surrender the power of three dimensional
data. Statistical methods to analyze visual data are needed, particularly to detect subtle
phenotypes. 

Morgan et al. (2018) have utilized the open source program, Ilastik, which employs a training based machine learning, to eliminate the image noise. Then they preformed principal component analysis to align commissures between samples, reducing misalignment artifacts, and implemented a cylindrical coordinate system which preserves image dimensionality normally lost in maximum intensity projection (MIP), which facilitates presentation of the data, but sacrifices much of the complexity and relational data contained in the image. Then they reduced the points identified by the program as belonging to the structure to a set of landmark points that describe the shape and distribution of signal corresponding to the structure. Finally, using the landmark system, we are able to identify and quantify structural differences and changes in signal distribution between wild type and mutant commissures.

Shape could be described by locating a finite number of points on each specimen which are called landmarks. There are three basic types of landmarks: scientific, mathematic and pseudo-landmarks. A scientific landmark is a point assigned by an expert that corresponds between objects in some scientifically meaningful way, for example the corner of an eye. Mathematical landmarks are points located on an object according to some mathematical or geometrical property of the figure. Since it does not assume a preference of one location to another, it is particularly useful in automated morphological recognition and analysis for under-studied structure. Pseudo-landmarks are constructed points on an object, located either around the outline or in between scientific or mathematic landmarks. It is often used to approximate continuous curves (Dryden and Mardia, 2016). This research has chosen to calculate an automatic set of landmarks distributed across the structure in order to avoid introducing bias due to expectations about where biological differences should emerge.

The SVM algorithm is a classification algorithm that provides state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of application domains, image classification. During the past few years, SVM has been applied very broadly within the field of computational biology especially in pattern recognition problems, including protein remote homology detection, microarray gene expressions analysis, prediction of protein-protein interactions, etc. 

In 1999, Jaakkola et al. ushered in stage 4 of the development of homology detection algorithms with a paper that garnered the “Best paper” award at the annual Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference. Their primary insight was that additional accuracy can be obtained by modeling the difference between positive and negative examples. Because the homology task required discriminating between related and unrelated sequences, explicitly modeling the difference between these two sets of sequences yields an extremely powerful method. The algorithm described in that paper is called SVM-Fisher. 

The SVM-Fisher method (Jaakkola et al., 1999, 2000) couples an iterative HMM training scheme with the SVM. For any given family of related proteins, the HMM provides a kernel function. First, the HMM is trained on positive members of the... (to be continued)



# Data
We have 43 wildtypes samples and 35 mutant samples for training and testing. There are 152 landmarks for each sample, with each of them containing the following variables:
number of points in that wedge
median R (μm): the median of the distances to the center of the slice of all the points in that wedge. 
alpha (μm): distance from the center of the landmark to the midline
theta (radian): the degree that shows the location of the wedge of a slice

We used the number of points and the median R to do classification via support vector machine. For missing ‘median R’ values due to absence of points in particular landmarks, we filled them with the median value of all the points in that landmark.


## Variables
Number of points
Median r
Alpha
Theta

## Tidy Data
The original landmarks data is a wide table containing the sample index and all the columns holding information regarding the minimum and maximum values of Alpha and Theta, number of points, median r value, and the type of sample for a particular sample in each landmark. However, because all of such variables were joined by underscores in the variable names, such as `-14.29_-4.76_-0.79_0.0_50_pts` or `-14.29_-4.76_-0.79_0.0_50_r` and the value in each cell refers to the median r value or number of points, it was very difficult to see what each column actually represented. The ideal format of the data set was to have the sample index, minimum and maximum Alpha, minimum and maximum Theta, number of points, median r, and type of sample each be its own column. Hence, three key functions were used from the tidyr package: gather, separate, and spread. The gather function separated the dataset into key and value pairs for each index. The key was the column name containing all essential information connected by underscores and the value included the number of points or median r value. Then, the separate function separated the result from the gather function divided the column connected by underscore into 5 different columns, named as `min_alpha`, `max_alpha`, `min_theta`, `max_theta`, and `ptsOrR`. This was added to the result of the gather function that contained the index and value of each cell, either median R or number of points. Afterwards, the spread function widened the already wide table by expanding the `ptsOrR` column by creating two columns, each column representing median R and the number of points. 

## Missing Value
Samples with missing values are eliminated by Supporting vector machine. For wedges that do not have any point in it, `median r` cannot be calculated, which means that these sample will be eliminated when running SVM. Wedges without points have biologically meanings, and we should not ignore these wedges in our model. In order to keep the wedges in our model, we need to artificially pick a `median r` value to replace the missing ones. Supporting vector machine is sensitive to outliers, so we cannot pick an `r` value that could become outliers. We decided to calculate the mean of `median r` for the nth landmark of all 78 samples, and then we replace the missing `median r` values with the mean.

# Supporting Vector Machine
SVM’s have been proven to be a powerful algorithm for supervised clustering. During the past few years, SVM has been applied very broadly within the field of computational biology especially in pattern recognition problems. The goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane Yi(β0 + β1Xi1 + β2Xi2) = 0 that separates the nearest data as clean as possible. The parameters βi are found by solving the optimization problem below. 

C: tuning parameter, toleration of violation.
M: margin, distance of the closest points to the hyperplane.
εi : slack variable, correct/incorrect classification of a point.

## What is SVM?
(SH)
SVM’s have been proven to be a powerful algorithm for supervised clustering. A good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class.

###The optimization problem

- The function of the hyperplane:

$f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2 $

if $f(x) = 0$: the observation is on the hyperplane. 

$ y * ( \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2 )$ is the perpendicular distance from the ith observation to the hyperplane. If it's >0, the observation falls at the right side of the hyperplane and vice versa.


## Implementation
### Cross-Validation
Because we are working with a small dataset, we used the leave-one-out cross validation method to test our model.
For each testing sample, we built 152 SVMs for each landmark.
For each SVM, we used 10-fold cross validation to select a tuning parameter C value among 0.1, 1 and 10.
After we get precision scores and predictions of each landmark, we will present the distribution of the landmarks’ precision scores (Figure 3).
The user would then be allowed to set a threshold for certain precision scores to select out a subset of landmarks that are considered significant.
A majority vote would then be performed among the selected landmarks to get an overall prediction for the sample.

### Improvement: 

Itenerating machine learning

Instead of cross-validation, better results (what kind of better results) could be achieved by using itenerating machine learning method. In iterative machine learning we repeat the process of training and testing several times. At the first round the user gives examples of objects belonging to some classes and the machine learning algorithm is trained with this data. In the second round, the algorithm shows examples of objects it thinks that belong to these classes. Now, the user merely adds objects to the improved training set which the machine learning algorithm has put into a wrong class. That is, the user only corrects the “misunderstandings” of the algorithm. In this way we can concentrate on difficult examples of objects that are hard to classify or are for some reason easily missed by humans. Such objects may lie close to the decision boundaries or in the periphery in the multidimensional feature space. This iterative process is continued until the machine learning algorithm does not make any mistakes or the classification results do not improve anymore.
