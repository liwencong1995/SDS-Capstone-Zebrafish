# Introduction
(PL)

# Literature Review
(Shuli)

# Data
(PL)
48 Wildtypes
14 mutants
## Variables
Number of points
Median r
## Missing Value
Samples with missing values are eliminated by Supporting vector machine. For wedges that do not have any point in it, `median r` cannot be calculated, which means that these sample will be eliminated when running SVM. Wedges without points have biologically meanings, and we should not ignore these wedges in our model. In order to keep the wedges in our model, we need to artificially pick a `median r` value to replace the missing ones. Supporting vector machine is sensitive to outliers, so we cannot pick an `r` value that could become outliers. We decided to calculate the mean of `median r` for the nth landmark of all 52 samples, and then we replace the missing `median r` values with the mean.

## What is SVM?
(SH)
SVMâ€™s have been proven to be a powerful algorithm for supervised clustering. A good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class.
